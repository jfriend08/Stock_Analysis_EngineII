The algorithm evaluates how close the relationship between any two companies would be. The definition of "relationship" is how frequently two companies are mentioned in the same article. Since the true "relationship" can change gradually, we set time-dacay weights for different years, e.g. in recently year the weight is 10, and for the farmost year the weight decreases to 4.




Data: over 160,000 financial news articles from Bloomberg News Website uploaded on google dirve.
