Description:
Use binary online logistic regression model to predict the probability of a company's revenue trend in the next year: either increasing revenue for the next fiscal year (e.g. revenue in 2015 is higher than revenue in 2014) or decreasing/negative revenue for the next fiscal year (e.g. revenue in 2015 is lower than revenue in 2014; or both revenues for 2015 and 2014 are negative, which means the company is losing money in both the current and the predicted year).



Model:

Online Logistic Regression Factor Model

Y = trend of revenue in 2015 with logit distribution (Y is binary classification. class 1: increasing revenue; class 0: decreasing revenue)

Xs are 10 factors from the year 2014:
X1 = Current ratio
X2 = Free Cash Flow/Sales
X3 = Gross Margin
X4 = Asset Turnover (Average)
X5 = Receivables Turnover
X6 = Free Cash Flow/Sales
X7 = Operating Margin
X8 = Debt to asset ratio
X9 = Operating cash flow per share
X10 = Operating cash floww/total assets



Model Evaluation:

65% accuracy. It is a "good"/"acceptable" prediction accuracy level for financial model.


Data:
Training data: "alldata" file, data from 2011 to 2013;

Predictio data: "2014" file, to predict revenue trend in 2015;

Output: "output" file, first column is stock tag; second column is the probability of increasing revenue in 2015;
e.g. 
IBM	0.830
IBM has a probability of 83% achieving higher revenue in 2015 than that in 2014. We can classify IBM as class "1".
