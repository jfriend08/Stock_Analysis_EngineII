Each mapper task will accept a company tag. It then will go to Seekingalpha website to parse the latest news and comments (usually tens of thousands for big stock and hundreds for ordinary stocks). The second step is to simply call the Stanford NLP library to "grade" the sentimenal score for each comment/news and calculate the average sentimental score for each stock. Higher score means more positive sentiment.

Data: latest news/comments from SeekingAlpha website

Ouput: output/part-r-00000

This algorithm has to be run on real hadoop cluster.

The final output is ”score”, the Average item on the last line is the average benchmark for all the stocks, which also needs to be printed.
